# Project guidelines
These are the official **mojs-contrib** guidelines for the **mojs** library.

## Goals
- propose an alternative to the official **mojs** library that is now deprecated and unsupported
- keep the library **up to date** with dependencies
- make mojs sparkle again with a lot of **new features** :tada:

## Timeline
- build a solid team of contributors
- make the repository "clean" (typo, dead links, etc.)
- make the documentation "clean" (typo, dead links, etc.)
- build a gh-pages website (clone of mojs.io), see [mojs-website](https://github.com/mojs-contrib/mojs-website)
- fix critical bugs in the library + fix dependencies to make it "clean" and up to date
- build an NPM package attached to the [@mojs-contrib](https://github.com/mojs-contrib) organization, probably starting at version @0.288.2
- build an **official v1.0.0**
- add features, tests, fix issues, etc.
- then finally... start building a v2

## Contribute

- discussions needs to be made on the appropriate [Slack channel](https://mojs-contrib.slack.com): please don't use issues or pull requests for that
